#use different color panels for each queue
have each q thereby color coded

Tasks:

    -overall design
        -using style.css
        -background colors for queues so you can tell where you are?
        - background for whole page to make it look nicer
            - tried it I thought it was worse simple sometimes better

    - TA page design
        -what happens when take top or take student is pressed
            - modal?
        - Put in the details somewhere
        
        
    - Student Page design
        - use style.css
        - keep as sm columns as seeing both queues is more important
        - students don't need to see details
    
    -Make more populated page
    
    -Demo
        - decide on control flow and link stuff together
    
    - Presentation
        - Lots of it is intentionally functional over best looking
        - This could be polished out to a degree
        - Stuff we would like to add but lacked time / skills
            -reorderable queues for mobile
    
    -THe word queue no longer looks like a word to message

    -would like to get the form to auto collapse on submit
